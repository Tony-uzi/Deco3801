# Deco3801
This is the translator part with all versions while the progress is keeping updating, please run the latest version
The translator is going to decode the machine code which is provided by the previous problem-solver and show the human readable instructions
The 'test.txt' file is used as a sample of problem-solver's output. In translator.JS, just run it(the default name of the test file has already been set as 'test.txt').
The translator used reflection to corresponding every character in machine code and change it into instruction about the shapes with color in every layer. The operation code will be translated into an explaination about what the user will exactly do to create the object shape.
